# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to exploring, analyzing, and visualizing COVID-19 data to uncover insights into the pandemic's impact across different locations worldwide. Utilizing a range of SQL techniques, including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Data Type Conversion, this analysis aims to provide a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 situation.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL Joins**: Merging data from different sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- **CTEs and Temporary Tables**: Organizing data processing steps and intermediate results for complex queries.
- **Windows Functions**: Performing advanced calculations across sets of rows that are related to the current row.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Summarizing data to help uncover patterns and trends.
- **Creating Views**: Simplifying access to complex queries by storing them as views for future use.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensuring data is in the correct format for analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key SQL queries designed to extract meaningful insights from the COVID-19 dataset, including:

1. **Initial Data Exploration**: Understanding the basic structure and content of the dataset.
2. **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths**: Analyzing the death rate in comparison to the total cases by location.
3. **Total Cases vs. Population**: Examining the extent of infection spread within the population.
4. **Countries with Highest Infection and Death Rates**: Identifying locations with the most significant impact relative to their population.
5. **Population Vaccinated**: Assessing the progress of vaccination efforts globally.

## Visualization Goals

The extracted data will serve as a foundation for creating visual representations to better understand:

- The trend of daily new cases and deaths.
- Vaccination progress across different populations.
- The relationship between testing rates and positive cases.
- The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems, including hospital and ICU admissions.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, ensure you have access to SQL Server or a similar database management system where you can execute SQL queries. The project relies on publicly available COVID-19 data from sources such as [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, including additional analyses, visualizations, or enhancements to the existing SQL queries. Please feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests.
